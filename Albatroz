Theory – Dynamic Soaring

Dynamic soaring exploits wind shear between air layers of different velocities.

An albatross gains kinetic energy when crossing wind gradients while performing
controlled turns.

This algorithm simplifies the phenomenon into:
- Two wind layers
- Energy balance
- Heuristic controller
- Stability optimization

Although simplified, it captures the essential mechanism used by albatrosses
and is suitable for computational experiments.
